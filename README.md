# SARS-CoV-2-Mutation-Spectrum
Here, we characterize the molecular spectrum of de novo mutations for SARS-CoV-2 from transcriptomic data obtained from virus-infected cell lines, enabled by the use of sporadic junctions formed during discontinuous transcription as molecular barcodes. We find that de novo mutations are generated in a replication-independent manner, typically on the genomic strand, and highly dependent on mutagenic mechanisms specific to the host cellular environment. De novo mutations will then strongly influence the types of base substitutions accumulated during SARS-CoV-2 evolution, in an asymmetric manner favoring specific mutation types. Consequently, similarities between the mutation spectra of SARS-CoV-2 and the bat coronavirus RaTG13 which have accumulated since their divergence strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 evolved in a host cellular environment highly similar to that of bats before its zoonotic transfer into humans. Collectively, our findings provide data-driven support for the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2.

For pipline:
There are two directories, Script and Result, under each folder. 
The shell script in the Script directory contains the process and interpretations of using these scripts. 
The Result directory contains the intermediate results and the final results shown in the manuscript.
